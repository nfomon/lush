lush
====

lush is a command language interpreter.  It helps the user compose and run commands, manage system processes, manipulate the filesystem, and more.

A shell has to make a trade-off between simplicity for command invocation, and the expressive power of a rich embedded toolset.  Most shells include a scripting language with an awkward and error-prone syntax, designed as such so that it does not interfere with the user's ability to write commands.  General-purpose scripting languages, conversely, tend to be very poor environments for running programs interactively.

lush takes a different approach in order to minimize the trade-off.  The key is to provide a simple syntax with which to switch between the command invocation shell and the embedded scripting language.  When the two modes are complementary, an elegant user experience emerges.

        all there is to lush
        { write code in curly braces }
        : colon runs commands


quick example
=============
Assume `lush:` is the lush prompt.

        lush: cd /home/mike
        lush: ls animals/
        Bear  Cow  Duck

        lush: echo "roar!" > Bear
        lush: echo "moo!" > Cow
        lush: echo "quack!" > Duck

        lush: { var animal = 'Duck' }
        lush: echo {animal}
        Duck

        lush: cat animals/{animal}
        quack!

        lush: {
                  each file f in ./ {
                      print(f.name ~~ 'says,')
                      : cat {f}
                  }
                  : echo "That's all, folks"
              }
        Bear says,
        roar!
        Cow says,
        moo!
        Duck says,
        quack!
        That's all, folks

        lush: exit

command-mode
============

lush starts in command-mode.  Every line is a command, just like 'bash' or
'cmd.exe'.

        lush: cd /home/mike
        lush: ls animals/
        Bear  Cow  Duck

lush inherits many useful features from bash and other interactive shells:

 - command history
 - pipelines and redirection
 - job control
 - ...

code-mode
=========

The lush scripting language is a statically-typed, prototype-based
object-oriented programming language.  It tries to be simple and idiomatic, but
with small amounts of magic to assist in its role as an interactive shell
language.  Some features:

 - Native path literals and other filesystem types
 - Native job control types
 - Static type safety
 - Familiar declarative style
 - Typist-friendly syntax
 - Concurrency (coming soon)
 - Shell security-aware string escapes
 - Composable prototypes with multiple inheritance
 - Elegance
