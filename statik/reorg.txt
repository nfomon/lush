Rule is just a factory for STree nodes.
 - Give it auto_ptr<ComputeFunc>, auto_ptr<OutputFunc>
    - it doesn't use these, just clones them for STree nodes
 - AddChild(auto_ptr), AddChildRecursive(Rule*), ownership vec (vector<bool> eeps)
 - SilenceOutput, CapOutput are kinda funny

ComputeFunc, OutputFunc are Init(STree&) to their STree node on STree constructor
 - except for the Rule funcs which are just prototypes

STree:
 - Connector&
 - Rule&
 - State
 - parent*
 - isClear
 - vector<STree*> children, depth
 - IConnection
 - auto_ptr<ComputeFunc>, auto_ptr<OutputFunc>
